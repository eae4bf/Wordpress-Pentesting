## Pentesting Report

1. Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - [ ] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability types: Cross-Site Scripting
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.1
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: ![Stored XSS](./GIFS/lab7gif1.gif) 
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: An attacker can inject Javascript into Wordpress comments, which is then triggered when the script is viewed. So first, I logged into the admin account, and published a new page that could recieve comments where the attack could occur. Then I wrote the following in a comment: "<svg/onload=alert('XSS')/>", and published the comment. Whenever the page was reloaded the alert would appear, therefore proving the attack was successful.
  - [ ] Affected source code: source code couldn't be found, website used for reference: https://klikki.fi/adv/wordpress2.html

2. Large File Upload Error XSS
  - [ ] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability types: Cross-Site Scripting
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.15
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: ![Large File](./GIFS/lab7gif2.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: I first googled images that were larger than 20MB, and downloaded an image to my Desktop that I could upload into wordpress. I renamed the file "world.topo.200407.3x21600x21600.C1<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>.jpg" so that when the image was uploaded, the file name would display the alert. I created a new media file in Wordpress and when I went to upload the file, the XSS alert popped up proving the attack was successful.
